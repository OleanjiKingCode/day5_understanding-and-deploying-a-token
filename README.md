CA:0x1095a3C5a0e4a05ce8FD4EA24b55DCCfE6c0104e

and all the rest of the code apart from code.sol are not used they are imported from the remix npm library so not needed and one shouldnt us e the github link to import as it is prone to change. i think
 then they are flatened and copied to verify and publish the smart contract
